# advent-of-code-2022

## building

dependencies:

- g++ with c++20 support
- make

then just run:

    make

## usage

to run a day's solution on an input:

    ./target/aoc2022 <day> <file>

to run the test suite:

    ./target/aoc2022test [day ...]

## development

1.  add a new file in `src/solutions`, e.g. `src/solutions/day26.cc`
2.  implement functions to parse, solve part 1, and solve part 2, and run tests
3.  call `REGISTER_SOLUTION(day26, parse, solve1, solve2, test)` in your file
4.  run your tests with `./target/aoc2022test day26`
5.  run your solution on an input with `./target/aoc2022 day26 <file>`

see `src/aoc.h` for more details on solution registration and existing
solutions in `src/solutions` for examples.
